#### Hello! My name is Oxana, and this is my technical writing portfolio on GitHub. Here, I have gathered sample materials reflecting my experience and skills in the field of technical writing. In my portfolio, you will find:

+ User Guide for a Wide Audience on the Subject of "How to Create a Table of Contents in Google Docs."
+ API Documentation Sample: A model that helps circuit engineers create reports about board testing after repair.
+ Operator Manuals in the Russian Language: Samples of operator manuals developed in compliance with standards.

#### I hope that my portfolio gives you an insight into my competencies and working style in the field of technical writing. Feel free to ask any questions and discuss potential collaborations. Welcome!
