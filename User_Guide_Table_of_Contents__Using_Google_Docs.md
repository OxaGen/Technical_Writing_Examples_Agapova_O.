*Creating a table of contents in Google Docs makes the document more convenient for navigation and reading. 
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a table of contents:*

### Step 1. Prepare Your Document
+  Open your Google Docs document for which you want to create customized headers. Ensure that your document has the headings or sections you wish to include in the table of contents.
    + If your document has these headings, proceed to Step 4.
    + If it does not, move on to Step 2.

### Step 2. Highlight the Heading Text
+  Highlight the text that you want to format as a header. This can be a title, section heading, or any text you want to stand out.

### Step 3. Access the "Paragraph Styles" Menu
+ In the top menu bar, click on "Format." A drop-down menu will appear.
+ In the "Format" menu, go to "Paragraph styles." Another menu will appear to the side.
+ Select the heading style that suits your needs. Typically, these are headings of levels 1, 2, and 3 (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3).

### Step 4. Customize the Header
+ Return to your highlighted text, which you want to format as a header.
+ Modify the font, size, boldness, or any other desired formatting elements using the text formatting options in the top menu bar. Make it look exactly how you want your header style to appear.
